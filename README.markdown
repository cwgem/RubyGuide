The Ruby Guide
==============

Introduction
------------

Welcome to the Ruby guide. I'm the main author Chris White, and this guide was created out of the need for more structured documentation and comprehensive documentation. Not only will it describe the core language, but also the standard library and some third party extensions. Due to the fact that Rails already has very comprehensive documentation, it will not be mentioned in great detail (possibly listed as a web development  option).

This guide is licensed [Attribution 3.0 Unported (CC BY 3.0)](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) to allow the community to contribute to it. This license is available in the repository under the filename LICENSE. Unlike a book which can become quickly outdated as the language progresses, my hope is that an open source community driven guide will help keep the content fresh. If you would like to help out, you may [file issues](https://github.com/cwgem/RubyGuide/issues) or submit a pull request to the [main repository at GitHub](https://github.com/cwgem/RubyGuide/).

Requirements
------------

The guide is written in [Asciidoc](http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/) and source highlighted is handled by the [Pygments](http://pygments.org/) backend. [Pygments' installation instructions](http://pygments.org/download/) contain information about how to obtain it. Once both Pygments and Asciidoc are installed, files can be output to HTML using the following command:

``asciidoc -a pygments= -b xhtml11 -o out/file.html file.txt``
